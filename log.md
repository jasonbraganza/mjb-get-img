Came up with the bones of this project today.  
  
Spent a lot of time today figuring out whether I could use the Requests library in my little project or not.  
I want mjb-get-img to be MIT licensed, while Requests is Apache licensed.  
After quite a bit of research online, I think I am in the clear.  
If it transpires that I cannot in the future, I’ll figure out a way then.  

I couldn’t think of a good name, so mjb-get-img (m-j-b get i-m-g), it is.  

Found a handy README generator at [Make a Readme](https://www.makeareadme.com/).  
Found lots of license clarity and boilerplate at [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/).

Trying to make up for it, by working a bit extra today.  
could not get anything done, even after an hour.

Early start today.   
Hope brains work.   
  
made a lot of progress   
got a url, made sure there was only one url on the command line, sanitised the url, reached out on the web for it and put it into an object.  
created a rough README and requirements.txt file  
more tomorrow

Moved all my soup making stuff into a make_soup class.  
got a pretty soup thing out of the links i put in. yay!  
read through the text and realised that all the images have img tags.   
so i ought to read them somehow and process them?  
reading the beautiful soup documentation to see how to do it.  
ok, figured it out. it’s on the first page of the documentation itself. really handy.   
so using a `find_all` method on my soup object to get the img tags, gives me a *list of all the tags.
