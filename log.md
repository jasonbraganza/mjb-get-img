Early start today.  
Hope brains work.

Missed a day.  
Trying to make up for it, by working a bit extra today.  
could not get anything done, even after an hour.

Came up with the bones of this project today.  
  
Spent a lot of time today figuring out whether I could use the Requests library in my little project or not.  
I want mjb-get-img to be MIT licensed, while Requests is Apache licensed.  
After quite a bit of research online, I think I am in the clear.  
If it transpires that I cannot in the future, I’ll figure out a way then.  

I couldn’t think of a good name, so mjb-get-img (m-j-b get i-m-g), it is.  

Found a handy README generator at [Make a Readme](https://www.makeareadme.com/).  
Found lots of license clarity and boilerplate at [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/).
